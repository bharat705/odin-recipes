<h2 class="headings subhead">Description</h2>
<p>
    Paneer Naan is a delightful variation of the traditional Indian naan bread, infused with a flavorful paneer (Indian cottage cheese) filling. This soft, pillowy flatbread is a popular choice in Indian cuisine, known for its delicious blend of textures and flavors. The dough is enriched with yogurt and a touch of ghee or butter, making it incredibly soft and pliable. The paneer filling, often seasoned with spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala, adds a savory and slightly tangy flavor that complements the naan perfectly.

<p>
    Baked in a tandoor or on a hot griddle, Paneer Naan develops a beautiful golden-brown crust with a tender, cheesy interior. It is a versatile accompaniment to a variety of Indian curries and gravies, from rich and creamy butter chicken to spicy vegetable korma. Paneer Naan can also be enjoyed on its own, with a simple side of pickle or yogurt, making it a delicious and satisfying bread option for any meal.

        <li>Add 1/2 cup of yogurt and 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil to the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Gradually add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of warm water while mixing, until a soft, elastic dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 1 hour.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong>Prepare the Paneer Filling:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>In a bowl, combine 1 cup of grated or crumbled paneer, 1 small finely chopped onion (optional), 1-2 finely chopped green chilies (optional), and 2 tablespoons of chopped cilantro (optional).</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon of coriander powder, 1/4 teaspoon of cumin powder, 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of red chili powder.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
