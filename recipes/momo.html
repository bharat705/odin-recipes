<h2 class="headings subhead">Description</h2>
<p>
    Momo is a popular South Asian dumpling that originated in Tibet and has since become a beloved dish across Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of India. These bite-sized delights are made by filling thinly rolled dough with a variety of savory ingredients, often including finely minced meat, vegetables, or a combination of both. The fillings are seasoned with aromatic spices, garlic, ginger, and herbs, which give momos their distinctive, flavorful taste.
</p>
<p>
    Momos can be steamed, fried, or boiled, depending on regional preferences and the desired texture. Steamed momos are the most common, offering a soft and tender bite, while fried momos have a crispy outer layer that contrasts beautifully with the juicy filling inside. They are typically served with a spicy dipping sauce known as "achar," made from tomatoes, chili peppers, and other seasonings. Whether enjoyed as a snack, appetizer, or main course, momos are a versatile and satisfying dish that reflects the rich culinary heritage of the Himalayan region.

    <li>Onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>Garlic, minced</li>
    <li>Ginger, minced</li>
    <li>Green onions or scallions, finely chopped</li>
    <li>Cilantro, chopped (optional)</li>

    <li>Black pepper or chili powder (for heat)</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="headings subhead">Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour with a pinch of salt. Gradually add water while mixing until a firm, elastic dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
  
    <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine 1 pound (approximately 450g) of ground meat (chicken, pork, beef, or lamb) with finely chopped onions, garlic, ginger, green onions, and cilantro (optional). Add 1-2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 teaspoon each of ground cumin and ground coriander, salt to taste, and a pinch of black pepper or chili powder. Drizzle 1-2 tablespoons of oil over the mixture and mix thoroughly.</li>
  
    <li><strong>Assemble the Momos:</strong> Divide the dough into small balls and roll each into a thin, circular wrapper, about 3-4 inches in diameter. Place about 1 tablespoon of the meat filling in the center of each wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half and pinch the edges together to seal, creating pleats or a simple half-moon shape.</li>
  
    <li><strong>Cook the Momos:</strong> Lightly grease a steamer basket and arrange the momos so they do not touch each other. Steam the momos over boiling water for about 10-12 minutes, or until the dough becomes translucent and the meat is cooked through. For a crispy texture, you can also pan-fry the steamed momos in a small amount of oil until the bottoms are golden and crispy.</li>
  
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the momos hot with a spicy tomato-based dipping sauce (achar) or soy sauce on the side.</li>
  </ol>
