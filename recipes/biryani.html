<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish that has become synonymous with celebration and comfort in South Asian cuisine. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, Biryani is a harmonious blend of aromatic basmati rice, tender meat (often chicken, lamb, or goat), and a medley of spices that infuse each grain with a rich, savory essence. What makes Biryani unique is the layering technique, where the marinated meat and partially cooked rice are arranged in alternating layers, often topped with caramelized onions, fresh herbs, and a sprinkle of saffron-infused milk for added richness and color.

<p>
    Each region has its own interpretation of Biryani, from the Hyderabadi Biryani with its robust flavors and the use of slow-cooking (dum) technique, to the Kolkata Biryani, known for its subtle sweetness and the surprising addition of potatoes. Biryani is more than just a meal; itâ€™s an experience that brings together diverse flavors and culinary traditions in a single dish. Whether served with cooling raita, spicy pickles, or a simple salad, Biryani is a dish that promises warmth and satisfaction in every bite.

<h2>Steps</h2>  
<ol>
    <li><strong>Marinate the Protein:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder, cumin powder, salt, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Add your choice of protein (chicken, lamb, goat, or vegetables) to the marinade, ensuring it's well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for better flavor absorption.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Rinse 2 cups of basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt, and whole spices like bay leaves, green and black cardamom, cloves, cinnamon sticks, and cumin seeds.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked rice to the boiling water and cook until it's 70-80% done (rice should still have a bite). Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong>Prepare the Protein:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add thinly sliced onions and fry until golden brown and caramelized. Remove half of the fried onions for garnish.</li>
        <li>Add marinated protein to the pot and cook until the meat is browned and the spices are well-blended. Stir in chopped tomatoes and cook until soft.</li>
        <li>Add fresh green chilies, mint leaves, and cilantro to the pot. Cook until the meat or vegetables are tender and cooked through.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong>Layer the Biryani:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low. Spread the cooked protein evenly at the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of the partially cooked rice on top of the meat. Sprinkle saffron-soaked milk over the rice for color and flavor.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fried onions, fresh mint, cilantro, and optional ingredients like raisins and cashew nuts.</li>
        <li>If using, sprinkle a few drops of rose water or kewra water for aroma.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong>Cook the Biryani (Dum Method):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Cover the pot tightly with a lid. Seal the edges with dough or a heavy cloth to trap the steam.</li>
        <li>Cook on very low heat for 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Alternatively, place a heavy pan under the pot to prevent direct heat.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and let the Biryani rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Gently fluff the rice with a fork, mixing the layers together before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve the Biryani hot with raita, lemon wedges, fresh salad, and pickles on the side.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
